# C++ Basics

This README provides an overview of fundamental concepts in C++ programming. It covers data types, input/output operations, operators, conditional statements, loops, arrays, strings, pointers, and function calls.

## Data Types and Variables

### Data Types
- **int**: Used for whole numbers.
- **double**: Represents decimal numbers.
- **char**: For individual characters.
- **bool**: Holds true or false values.

### Variables
Declare variables to store and manipulate data of different data types.

## Input/Output Operations

Use **cin** for input and **cout** for output operations. It helps you interact with the user.

## Operators & Bitwise Operators

Learn about various operators such as arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators to perform different operations on data.

## Conditional Statements

Explore the use of **if** statements to make decisions in your code and the **switch** statement for multiple branching.

## Conditional Loops

Use **for** and **while** loops to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

## Arrays (1D & 2D) and Strings

Understand how to work with arrays, both one-dimensional and two-dimensional, as well as strings to manage text data.

## Pointers & Function Call

Learn about pointers, which are variables that store memory addresses, and how to call functions to modularize your code.

This repository provides a foundational understanding of C++ programming. You can explore code examples to deepen your knowledge and improve your programming skills.
